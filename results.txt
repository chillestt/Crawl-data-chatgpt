Therefore, most elementary students have already learned math or non-native languages, which differs from the past 10 or 20 years ago. Also, they learn subjects unrelated to academics, for instance, science food and how to prepare it. These things are important to them, as they have the knowledge to choose healthy food and prepare it properly, cooked or uncooked. Another reason students should learn about this is that they currently love junk food the most for their daily meals, which is not a good fact for the next generation to have a long life.\nNevertheless, the knowledge of academic subjects should be learned in line with non-academic ones. The main reason is that it will be their foundation for a successful business or career. Without this knowledge, although they have an adequate understanding of the non-academic matter, they will find it hard to compete with other business competitors or candidates in any job recruitment.

Discuss both views and give your opinion?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nEssay: \nWith diet and nutrition becoming more and more popular nowadays, the food industry started to attract a significant number of people to join in, students included. While young people today are encouraged by many to pursue knowledge in related fields, some argue that school time should be invested in other important subjects. Personally, I strongly disagree with the latter.\nThe insignificance of food study is a misconception because of two major reasons. First of all, food is one of our most fundamental needs, but that doesn't make it less important than other fields. In fact, contrary to the common belief, it is actually a subject that still requires much research. For example, we are yet aware of the exact effects of different nutrtients and chemicals on our physiological process. Another problem is the belief that food is not as promising as other science subjects such as biology and physics. However, the statistics said otherwise. In the past decades, profits generated from food industry have been climbing steadily and already overtaken some of the traditional forms.\nPursuing a degree in food science is never a waste of time but its value has become more prominent in recent years. Not only can it help individuals learn more about the mechanism behind food, but it also enables them to lead a heathier life. In addition, as public awareness in health increases, people are paying more attention to what they put in their mouth, so much so that they are willing to pay for a professional to formulate their meal plan, which is a career with great potential for students interested in food research.\nIn conclusion, students should be encouraged to study the science and procedures of preparing food because it is a topic just as important as any other subjects.\n", 'evalutation': 'Criterion 1: Task Achievement\nThe essay addresses both views mentioned in the prompt and provides a clear opinion.

Personal computers were introduced as recently as the early eighties. In this short time they have made a tremendous impact on our lives.

However, hey still continue this behavior. The main reason is that a cigarette has a chemical component which keeps people smoking and a vital solution to reduce smoking in public is to increase the cigarette price.\nWith regard to this issue, Nicotine is one of the chemicals that manufacturers use to produce a cigarette and its effect causes smokers to be addicted to the compound. As a result, even though these people understand the degree of this dangerous product, they are not likely to stop using it. Furthermore, many health organizations have announced research demonstrating that the factor that hugely affects smokers to not be able to resist smoking us not a cigarette, but Nicotine.\nIn order to counteract the situation, perhaps the most effective mitigation is for governments to set the minimum price of a cigarette on markets which is unaffordable for buyers. Consequently, this action possibly decreases the purchasing power of smokers and, subsequently, they tend to discontinue smoking. This is exemplified by the pilot project of Thai government which charge cigarette purchasers ten times higher than the market price in specific areas. After that the authorities conduct public surveys and find that more than 80% of people who used to smoke in the areas quit smoking.\nIn conclusion, people who smoke cannot change this habit due to Nicotine in a cigarette which can be addressed by governmental policy to raise the price of a cigarette with the view to promote citizens to cease smoking and take care of their health instead.\n', 'evalutation': 'Criteria 1: Task Achievement\n\nThe essay addresses both parts of the prompt, discussing the causes of why people continue to smoke and suggesting a solution to reduce smoking in society.

This essay will discuss the causes of the popularity of smoking and what can we do to reduce the number of smokers.\nOne of the main causes of people starting to smoke is the bad influence of others surrounding them. Most people start smoking at a young age, inspired by their peers or by people older than them already addicted to cigarettes. For example, research shows that nearly all questioned smokers started at a young age and, as they admit it, they started smoking so they can fit-in the surrounding social group. Furthermore, they say that they started smoking because they believed it looked â\x80\x9ccoolâ\x80\x9d and manly because their elders, like fathers, also did smoke.\nEven though, in the end, everybody is responsible for the bad choices they make, but it is apparent that something has to be done to reduce the hold that smoking has over society. Awareness campaigns and an increase in the cigarettes cost are the two most efficient ways to prevent people from starting smoking. For example, for the past decade in my country, cigarette advertisements on television or in magazines have been replaced with smoking awareness advertisements showing the horrible diseases caused by this habit. Additionally, every year rise in the cost of cigarettes can be observed. As a result, according to research done recently, the overall number of smokers in our country has been reduced by 50%.\nIn conclusion, it can be said that most people start smoking at a young age when they are most vulnerable to develop bad habbits and that is why social awareness campaigns have to be done to prevent the young generation from getting addicted to cigarettes.\n', 'evalutation': 'Criteria for evaluation:\n\n1.

Even though we were taught that smoke is harmful, we see people exhaling this thick fog everyday partly because some people think that it is cool and it can be purchased almost at every store. This essay will discuss deeply about what causes people to smoke and how this issue can be alleviated.\nFirstly, part of the society believes that it is trendy to smoke. In many pop culture, such as songs, movies, and novels portray smoking possitively. A comedy show that I have seen illustrates one of the character that smokes to be more cool, giving this character an untouchable aura, whilst other characters that did not smoke seem tangible and therefore mundane. Furthermore, cigarettes are easily accessable in any store. A recent study proved that over 80% of those eager to smoke for the first time actually started this behavior because they can buy it from their local shops. The trend from pop culture and the convenience in accessing smoke adds up to the reasons why some people continues with this habit.\nI believe that there are solutions that can tackle and reduce smoking, beginning with medias should portray smoking to have consequences that are relatable. A movie I have seen showed the protagonist's constant need for cigarette throughout the show. However, in the end when he finally unites with his crush, he develops a severe disease, mainly from his smoking habits, in which he regretted in the end. This method of portraying people who smoke totally made my younger niece scared of smoking. In addition, government should control the accessibility of cigarettes. Policies that result and fewer stores being able to sell cigarettes and increasing tax pricing of smoke of any kind will definitely make smoking less convenient for many people.\nIn conclusion, although many people knew how harmful smoking is, many people think it is cool to smoke and it is convenient and easy to buy. By making smoking less trendy in society and harder to access, I believe that smoking will be less attractive, hence reducing the number of smokers in society.\n", 'evalutation': 'Criteria 1: Task Achievement\nThe essay addresses the prompt by discussing the causes of smoking and suggesting ways to reduce smoking in society.

However, many ways to reduce smoking on society exist like the promotion of physical activity as well as medical treaments.\nEvidence strongly shows that the habit of smoking is triggered by the addictive side of tabasco. In fact, studies demonstrate that tabasco contain substances that affect areas in the brain which are reponsible of the feeling of pleasure and addiction. Thus, smoking becomes more and more pleasant and addictive. Moreover, smoking is a way of socialization for people. In fact, many individuals enjoy being gathered and discuss while they smoke a cigaret. They find it very relaxing and pleasant, so they do not plan to stop it as it allows them to meet new people for example. Nevertheless, I believe that the lack of awareness from people about the negative effects is a major component that explains why people do not want to stop smoking. Indeed, many surveys show that people do not know that smoking has several negative effetcs. They know about lungs cancer, despite it seems not to afraid them, but tooth and throat issues are less known in the vast majority of smokers.\nHowever, many ways exist in order to encourage people to stop smoking. In my opinion, physical activity and medical treatments are the most effective. In fact, governments have been investing a lot in the promotion of physical activity by the means of advertising campaigns. For instance, in the USA, surveys show that there is an increase of 20% of people doing physical activity in order to overcome their addiction issues related to smoking. Moreover, medical treatments have been improved over the last years so as to help people to cope with their addiction with smoking, and studies show that treatments are becoming more and more effective. For instance, in France, the number of smokers has decreased, and medical treatment is the second reason to explain this phenomenon, behind physical activity.\nTo conclude, even though there are many reasons that explain the addictive behaviours of people to keep smoking, I believe that there are several ways to improve this situation, particularly by the means of physical activity and medical treatments.\n', 'evalutation': 'The essay demonstrates a good understanding of the prompt and provides relevant reasons and examples to support the ideas.

How can we reduce smoking in society?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nEssay: \nAlthough it is well known that smoking causes severe damage to our bodies, many people cannot reduce the bad habit. This is a big problem because many people die of lung cancer every year, and social welfare expenditures are expensive. The point is why so many people continue to smoke and how we can let them stop smoking. In this essay, I will provide two reasons and related examples to solve the questions.\nFirst of all, once people are addicted to smoking, they cannot stop smoking without help. In my experience, my father was a heavy smoker. He wanted to quit smoking but could not do that by himself. Thus, he went to a hospital and met a well-experienced counselor. After my father got advice and medicine, he could cut the bad habit. Therefore, a counselor's help is definitely necessary.\nSecondly, cigarettes are still relatively cheap compared to alcohol. For instance, tobacco was very reasonable in Japan, my home country, several decades ago. Thus, so many people had the habit of smoking rather than drinking alcohol. Then the Japanese government raised the tax rate on cigarettes from 20 percent to 50 percent in order to strongly discourage people from smoking. Consequently, the smoking rate dropped dramatically. As Japan's case shows, the rise in the tax rate is quite effective in reducing smoking in a country.\nThere are probably many people who have different opinions and disagree with my way of thinking. However, considering the two specific reasons and related examples indicated above, I personally believe that addiction and low price are the two main factors of smoking and that the remedies for them are a counselor's advice and raise of tax.\n", 'evalutation': "Criteria for evaluation: \n1.

Although\nthere are many discussions around the world and some merits and demerits exists, I think that do homework is more important for children.\nInitially, some people strongly argue that children should have other activities than homework. They will be able to spare time for exercise so that their body strength and immunity will be stronger. In addition, especially in Japan, some parents become aware of the Japanese educational system regarding English is not well organized. Therefore, some parents are eager to educate private English lessons for children as younger as possible after school.\nOn the other hand, children are struggling to catch up with their teacher's class\neveryday. And they are required to learn several subjects in one day. Of course, children have a great ability to absorb a lot of memories like a sponge, but it must be hard for them to catch up with the school education curriculums because they need to learn several curriculums every weekday. Therefore, doing homework is a top priority for children to review what they learned every day. It is also effective for children by doing homework who are not so good at some subjects, like mathemathic, history, and so on. This is not only a great chance to enhance their good at subjects, and also helpful to overcome their difficult subjects. Otherwise, children will forget immediately and these weak subjects still remain as disliked subjects.\nFinally, studying, including homework is boring. In contrast, it is the most important role for children to learn fundamental subjects as young as possible because some adults who did not do homework often regret they should have done when they were children. In addition, if children accumulate education by getting older, they will envision their dream what kind of occupation they would like to become.\nhomework is necessary for children more than anything.\n", 'evalutation': "Overall, this essay addresses the prompt and presents both sides of the argument.

Many said "yes" and many said "no". Both sides have good and strong reasons, so let\'s compare them wisely.\nOn the "homework is bad for studentsâ\x80\x9d side, most people argue that most homeworks is time consuming, and forces students to do it instead of spending their free time afterschool. This also keeps the students inside the house instead of letting them be active and explore the surroundings. Some even said doing homework gives tiredness, stress, and boredom, especially on exam seasons. It also slowed down the social skills development of active students. Many people agreed that homeworks and assignments should be given in another time, instead of after school time, so students could have time to rest at home.\nOn the other hand, "homework is good for students\'\' side argued that most homeworks is designed to be done in around fifteen to thirty minutes (Or in other cases thirty minutes to an hour), and students still have time to rest and enjoy their life. Also, imagine if students don\'t have homework, instead of playing outside, they will rather watch televisions or play video games. In fact, doing homework sharpens your skills in what you practice, like mathematics or memorizing skills.\nIf students can manage their time, they won\'t feel stressed or tired. Because they didn\'t do it right away, and the homework stacked up, this made them not want to do it anymore. Or because they do their homework and do other things at the same time. They will get easily distracted, but if you do it focusly, everything will be good. Also you will be prepared for the next lesson.\nSo I agreed that homework is good for you, as long as it is optimized and isn\'t time consuming. If teachers are abusing it, then it will became a good way to torture students.\n', 'evalutation': "Criteria 1: Task Response\nThe essay responds to the prompt by discussing both sides of the argument and giving the writer's own opinion.

In fact, they believe that homework is a crucial part for the pupil education.\nPersonally speaking, I am convinced that homework are positive tools for scholar to remember and pratice what they have learnt in class, but it should be a small ratio rather than what they are currently asking.\nFrom my personal experience, I learnt that at the school age, children do not comprehend the importance of aknolwedge information in each different courses. As a result of it, pupil only focus on what they like, discarting subjects that are not in their taste and this is when homework plays a fundamental part. It helps scholar to fix in their memories the lesson they attended and from there building more ideas about it. Consequently, following the next courses will be easier for them. Not only does it help them to learn what has been thought, but also it gives them a method of study and habits which will be crucial for university or personal aknwoledgement. It set up the base to thrive on their own in the future.\nHaving said that, it is understandable if some people are against homework. Teachers might be given a heavy homework load to students, which is unfair because the children should also have the time to enjoy their childhood, playing and having fun. On the other hand, saying no to homework in their full is incorrect. If scholar are not having any homework, they will lose opportunity to learn and in the long run it will affect their productivities.\nTo conclude, I strongly believe that the benefits of homework outweigh the drawbacks.

Traditionally, schools have used homeworks as a pivotal tool to support childrenÂ´s education. However, in the past few years, some schools have piloted a homework-free approach. I believe that homework-based schools provide a more nurturing and effective education compared with homework-free schools.\nHaving homework most of the days helps children to develop their discipline. They might be interested in other activities like seeing friends or playing video games. However, children must learn to prioritize their homework over other activities, which promotes discipline. Similarly, if they want to do things different than their homework, children need to plan and adjust their time, thus learning valuable skills such as time-management. Both skills, discipline and time-management, will help children to perform better later in life. Additionally, it is reasonable to think that children who do their homework will be exposed to study topics for a longer period of time, thus deepening their learning experience. Therefore, they will be more knowledgeable in the future. Finally, one can expect that children who do their homework will be used to working for longer periods of time, which will be helpful during their transition to university and the working life.\nOn the other hand, homework-free schools also have advantages. These children will have more time at home to explore their own interests and hobbies. They could learn skills not typically taught at school like photography or singing. Since most children dislike homework, one could also hypothetize that children attending a homework-free school would be happier. Finally, one can expect that these children would be less stresssed.\nTo conclude, homework-based schools have more advantages for children than homework-free schools.

The economy of a country is directly co-releated to its quality of life. Nonetheless, there are other goals, equally important, which are usually unattended. In this essay I will asses whether or not economic progress should be the most important goal of a government.\nFirstly, money has huge importance due to the fact that it provides power. Furthermore, the most powerful countries are those who have more money. However, in the end, the value of a country is not measured by the amount of money it has, but by its education. A rich country is the one composed by educated people and that should be the main focus of a government. In fact, a country made of intelligent and resourceful people will somehow manage to increase its wealth, whereas if made of lazy people it will be doomed to poverty.\nSecondly, everything related to money and consecuently, economic progress, is always linked to greed. Aditionally, a gorverment that suffers from greed makes wrong decisions consistently. For instance, my birth country; Spain. If you dig into the spanish history you will see a huge number of greedy and unethical decisions made in seek of economic progress such as the american conquest.\nAll things considered, economic progess is a vital goal but not the most important one. Goverments should focus on more valuable things like education. Moreover, decisions regarding economy should never guided by greed. From my point of view, governments shoud give economic progress less importance and attend other matters such as education or social aids. If they create a real change with their decisions, economic progress will eventually be achieved.\n', 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay addresses the prompt and presents both views on the importance of economic progress for a government.

Some people,however, think that other types of progress are equally important for a country.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nEssay: \nSince the industrial revolution, our economy has continued to expand and develop at an impressive increasing rate. Hence, many goverments worldwide believe that their primary objective is to focus on the development of goods and services. Others however argue that other sectors and their progress are of an equal value and thus similar effort should be made across the board. In this essay I will discuss why although focus on the economic progress can be benefical for a country, I believe that similar emphasis should be put into all sectors to greater our civilisation as a whole.\nFirstly, It is an undisbutable fact that by govermental bodies contributing more so to the growth of industries, it provides for a better quality of life. More money being distributed to businesses and industries allows them to grow and expand, not only offering more employment oppurtunities but greater availabilty of services. For example, In Ireland during the 19th century era of the 'Celtic Tiger',the goverment supplied most of it's yearly budget towards economy. This in turn saw that the country saw an overall downfall of both the unemployment rate and in contrast the manufactoring and establishment of more and more bussiness across counties. This thus highlights how by contributing towards economy, it boosts living standards.\nHowever, in order to contribute to a nations development, this can not be achieved by one sectors progress alone. It is believed by many that by putting emphasis into other fields, for instance education, transport and health, we can better a country as a whole. For example, Japan saw an increase in employment rates once the local government began to contribute more of it's spendings towards the expansion of third level instituitions. Having a better academic background encouraged more and more people to actually seek employnment from already established businesses, which they would not have ever dreamed of doing before holding a diploma. This in turn has had a rippling effect across generations as standards of living continues to surge. Additionally, by governements aiding in better health and transport availabilty, we evidentely aid to the better development of a nation. By having a means of travelling to and from work and similarly a means to take greater care of ourselves, we improve the quality of life of the people across that region.\nTo conclude, the economic growth process is one that continues to rise to date. Most governments believe that their key goal is the progress of this area. However, in my opinion, by equally aiding other sectors such as education, transport and health, we can further impact our economies growth and better the quality of lives for generations to come.\n", 'evalutation': "Overall, this essay demonstrates a good understanding of the prompt and presents a clear argument.

What solutions can you suggest?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nEssay: \nThere is an ever-increasing number of bullying activities in numerous schools. Although it is widely believed that the potential cause is seeking social attention, it is unlikely to be true that school bullying is the appropriate method to build personal branding. Nevertheless, I firmly hold the opinion that every stakeholder shall uncover the most suitable solution to prevent those dreadful actions.\nTo begin with, the primary reason for school bullying is to express students' envy or frustration feelings. There is no denying that those students are bullied by their relatives, occasionally associated with the highest grades or prestigious achievements at school. Another essential consideration is the bullies occasionally have a lack of psychological well-being and look forward to damage other students' skills with dreadful aggression. This provides a typical illustration of the achievements that were achieved by my siblings.\nApart from this, some of the proper approaches could lend support to overcome bullying actions. It is often the case that dealing with oppressors is bitterly cumbersome, particularly for those students who are less capable of winning by standing up against bullies. However, I would like to reaffirm that they still have an opportunity to confront it, for instance, by documenting everything or finding someone in authority and explaining them thoroughly in order to take shelter.\nIn light of this evidence, it is crystal clear that school bullying is able to be eradicated with the presented techniques. Additionally, it might be better to leave the school and move into high-qualified schools rather than confront the bullies.\n", 'evalutation': "Overall, the essay addresses the given prompt and provides reasons and examples to support the writer's opinions.

It would be helpful to have separate paragraphs for the introduction, causes of bullying, solutions, and conclusion.

From my point of view, the causes of this problematic way to act in a community are multiple. It might be due to family issue, bad example from the society, social media and so on. Despite the origine of this behaviour, it should not be tollerate, but punished.\nTo start with, bullying is a fundamental issue in the youngester society that needs to be tackled as soon as possibile in order to guarantee to the pupils a better childhood. One of the reason why a scholar acts in that way could be found in the household environment. If parents are violent with their child, it could potentially lead the student to act aggressively towards his/her fellows in order to release the anger accumulated at home. Another example that can provoke this type of behaviour is in the society idols. Promote bullying in series tv, movies or throught social media can misguide the idea of right and wrong in a pupil's mind.\nHaving said that, possible solutions to avoid children acting as bullys can be addressed. Firstly, in schools schould exist a zero tollerance policy towards this concept. Secondly, It should be put in place some code of conduct to direct scholars to understand which behaviour is accepted. Thirdly, they could be helped with counseling with a psycologist. Least but not last, bullying should be condemned. Educational institute might not erase this issue, but they can tackle it teaching good discipline and penalizing pupils who act badly.\nTo sum up, in order to address the right solutions, that can be different from one child to another, school schould understand the cause of bullying throughout counseling and then help the student out.\n", 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay addresses the prompt and provides some relevant ideas.

It is becoming a serious problem and there is a need to solve this. In this essay, we would be considering two causes and possible ways to solve these.\nFirst of all, the rate at which children bullying each other in the school environment is rising. One major cause is that bullying breeds bullying, children who are faced with physical, mental and emotional abuse from homes tend to transfer their fustrations on their peers. They think that is how one is supposed to live, exacting authority to gain superiority on weaker peers in school. Another is children who has low self esteem, such students feels threatened over their classmates they taught to be more intelligent or having better physical appearance than them.\nAlthough, there are several causes of bullying, teachers should be taught how to identify children who are from abusive homes and inform the appropriate authority. These students would taken away from such toxic environment early and they would be sent for some pschological therapy. Meanwhile, education is also a key factor especially for children who have low self esteem. This should be done by forms such as role plays, presentation and drama, where these students are taught how to have self love and accepting what they can not change on their self.\nIn conclusion, children from abusive homes and those who have low self esteem are some of the reasons for bullying.

People are reluctant to stay in the stadium watching a 2-hour football match, which is proven by the constant nearly empty statiums.\nThese phenomena will bring several negative effects on both individuals and the society. First, many people will lose the ability of appreciating masterpieces of great authors like those listed above. Moreover, there would be fewer parents who like to buy their children novels of Austin or selective works of Shakespear, and thus among the next generation much more people may find "Pride and Prejudice" unfamiliar, and "Romeo and Juliet" alien to them.\nPeople losing interest in sports can be a heavy blow to the economy. If fans do not watch the matches, some football clubs would be on the brink of bankcrupt. The government will also lose a great amount of tax derived from sports industry.\nTo sum up, we have to acknowledge that people tend to hate devote much time to hobbies, including literature and football. It will cause negative effects, like losing appreciating abilities, and causing problems to the economy.\n', 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay addresses the given topic and presents arguments on why people are devoting less time to hobbies and the impact it has on individuals and society.

People try to cope with everything and do their best all the time but we do not have superpowers or an ability not to sleep 24 hours. Honestly, I firmly believe that it is closely linked to not having a hobby these days.\nNeedless to say, time spent on the leisure activities plunged compare to the last century. I firmly believe that one of the main reasons is an addiction to the usage of various technologies. The majority of teenagers cannot live a day without their phone. They try to hide from troubles in that unreal world of communication. I understand that a hobby can also be online, for instance, videogaming but, as I know, really few people perceive it that way. Honestly, the problem is not only in the modern decade, adults also often do not have a specific hobby. The reason of that can be only their overworking and willingness to achieve more than they have at the moment. This race to the best never ends and, sadly, affects others too. Children adopt the habits of their parents. It is a green light for young people to behave in the same way, to think only about work and do not spend any time outside.\nOn the other side, obesity, bad mental health and demotivation can be an effect caused by not having a passion for any activity. I have a great example of the topic - it is me. I had played football professionally for 5 years until I decided to quit the training because of a sense of disinterest in what I do with my life. After, although I started to feel worse and worse, I could not do anything else. I spend all day at the computer doing homework now. I firmly think that I am not the only person who cannot handle with feelings such as anxiety or sadness. Maybe it could be better if I had a stronger character but I guess that a large proportion of my peers think that they would never get enough of joy, therefore it is not only my problem.\nTo sum up, it is clearly understandable that internet and â\x80\x9ctendency to be depressedâ\x80\x9d of present generation are rapidly displacing hobbies from human life.

Cooperations between different countries exist almost on every occasion. As a result, there are inevitably large amounts of information that are exchanged and shared for various usages. However, access to information has remained to be one of the most debatable issues. Some people believe that information should be shared without restriction, while others insist that the foremost information shouldnâ\x80\x99t be exchanged for free. In my view, appropriate measures or costs can be taken to protect valuable information from being abused or stolen.\nIt is fairly easy to understand the view of people who are in favor of exchanging information as much as possible. To improve the quality of research or guarantee the success of cooperation, it is usually necessary to share resources and exchange minds with each other. Furthermore, the amount of shared information is often decisive to the time and result, which sometimes might be eagerly expected. For example, it is almost unimaginable that the vaccine of covid 19 was so quickly created without intensive international cooperation, which contains an enormous sum of shared knowledge and experience in the diverse field, from governments to universities. With the benefit of this sharing, the period of the vaccine, which can take more than ten years in the past, was immensely shortened this time and the quality of the vaccine is also prestigious over the world.\nNevertheless, the over-sharing of information could also be harmful and risky. There is every possibility that information of importance and value can be misused and eventually leads to severe problems if the intention of usage canâ\x80\x99t be proven as legal and righteous or the risk of information leakage exists through sharing. For example, if classified military information is hacked by terrorists while the governments of two countries are sharing and discussing their military intelligence, it will result in a horrible disaster that treats all the citizens. Therefore, it is necessary to take measures to protect the safety of sensitive information from unauthorized access.\nTo sum up, sharing information is certainly helpful and meaningful in improving a wide variety of cooperation.

It is no secret that major towns have a many vehicles and industries; these raise the concerns of environmental and noise pollution.A dirty sorrounding can be a source of outbreaks like cholera as it has been seen in the past.

Perhaps some people believe that there are more transparent in distinct research and information. However, some critics concern about some imformation not being shared freely as well. This eassy will discuss both these viewpoints in the following paragraphs.\nFirst of all, people tend to the more information the internet has, the more benefit the users get. This means that people will become more proficient in their majors and works due to gaining a lot of relevant resources online in different areas. A case in point is different professional like managers, doctors, teachers and lawers can require a wider range of references to complete and reach their working goals as well as improve the workplace situation.
